    <h3>Why this is my favorite</h3>

<div class="page-paragraph">
    <p> I read this book on a whim. I think I mentioned to someone that my school was putting on a play of the story, and they told me that it was a book they really loved. I needed a book to read, and they lent me their copy. I started by reading it whenever I finished schoolwork early in class, but I soon started reading it in my free time as well because I couldn't put it down. It's been several years since I've read it, so I don't remember the plot anymore, but I still remember how much I loved all the characters. My favorite character is Athos, and my favorite part is when they are making plans to get equipment, and Athos puts in absolutely zero effort, trusting it will all work out, and despite sitting around while everyone else works, coincidences stack up so he ends up being given all his supplies for free, just like he foretold. </p>
