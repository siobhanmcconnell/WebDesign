# Assignment 1 Reflection

The peers who gave me feedback responded positively to the color of the page, so I looked for ways to build on the color scheme. I made the block of the header bigger and made the color a tad darker so it would stand out more. I also put the subheading in a dark brown to differentiate it from all the black text. I experimented with putting the quotation at the top in another color, but it's in the same header type as the chapter headings, so changing it in CSS changed all of those headings as well, which I didn't end up liking. 

In my Figma iteration, I put a lot more space between things, but since I don't have a lot of text in the paragraphs, I thought it made it look too empty, so I ended up keeping some elements from the original design. I did use the margin-top, margin-bottom and horizontal line elements from this week to modify the space, and I think it made the design clearer, and made the page look more full. I used the horizontal line under the top quotation, and I thought that separated it from the rest of the content nicely.
