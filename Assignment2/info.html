    <p>"Perhaps the greatest 'cloak and sword' story ever written, The Three Musketeers, first published in 1844, is a tale for all time. Pitting the heroic young d'Artagnan and his noble compatriots Athos, Porthos, and Aramis against the master of intrigue, Cardinal Richelieu, and the quintessential wicked woman, Lady de Winter, Alexandre Dumas has created an enchanted France of swordplay, schemes, and assignations. The era and the characters are based on historical fact, but the glittering romance and fast-paced action spring from a great writer's incomparable imagination. From the retrieval of the queen's gift to ther lover in time to foil Richlieu's plot, to the melodramatic revelation of Lady de Winter's true identity, The Three Musketeers is the unchallenged archetype for literary romance and a perennial delight for generations of readers." - Lowell Bair</p>
